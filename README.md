# Screener.in Industry Filter Extension

A powerful Chrome Extension that adds **Industry-wise Filtering** capabilities to [Screener.in](https://www.screener.in/).

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Industry Filter Widget
- **Native Integration**: Adds a "By Industry" dropdown seamlessly into the Screener sidebar.
- **Searchable Dropdown**: Easily find industries with a type-to-search interface.

### 2. Broad Compatibility
Works on multiple Screener.in pages:
- **[Upcoming Results](https://www.screener.in/upcoming-results/)**
- **[Latest Results](https://www.screener.in/results/latest/)**
- **[Concalls](https://www.screener.in/concalls/)**
- **[Upcoming Concalls](https://www.screener.in/concalls/upcoming/)** Note: this doesn't work. It's a placeholder for when screener.in adds filtering support for upcoming concalls.
